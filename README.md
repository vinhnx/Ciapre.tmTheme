##### *Tips* #####
--

* Use great with [Aqua](https://github.com/cafarm/aqua-theme) theme - Prokit. You won't be disappointed!
* Font used `Consolas` - built in Windows, but alternatively, the open-sourced `[Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html)` is pretty close to it
